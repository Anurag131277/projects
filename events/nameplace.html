			Remember those golden days ?? Back in 90’s in a rainy day or a SUNNY day when we couldn’t go out to play!! ? And then NAME-PLACE-ANIMAL-THING was the savior !!  It is an interesting vocabulary building fun game which Literary wing offers you to play once more to cherish those old memories again.

			Each player needs a paper with four columns, one for Name, one for Place, one for Animal, one for Thing starting with the same alphabet.
